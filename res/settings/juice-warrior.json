Since Sensei will need more than his blender to make all their orders, let's help! When I throw you a fruit or vegetable, say Slice and Dice! If it's milk or yogurt, say Splash a dash! If ice, say Punch and crunch! And if I accidentally throw you a kitchen utensil, say Stop, don't drop!! to block it. Should Sensei and I show you what to do?"
